           Guitarist</h2>
        <em>publihed on September 29, 2024 by Goodysan</em>
        <p style="text-align: center;"> As a self taught guitarist, I have a few artists who have inspired me significantly in my musical journey. 
            <br> These three guitarists helped me to understand the soul, rhythm, and dedication required to create unique styles in my play<br>
            I have created this page as an homage to how thrdr artists have influenced me!

 Bob Dylan is considered one of the greatest songwriters of all time for his iconic and electic style. known for his folk ballads and acoustic blues inspired music was a pioneer during the 60's counter culture <br>
    His often obscure lyricism coupled with his simplistic chord progressions taught me how to write complex songs without having to over exert myself with intricate playing styles. <br>

       This image is a PNG! <br> David Gilmour is one of my all time favorite guitaritsts due to his mastery of chord bending and soloing. <br> One thing I loved about Gilmour's style of play was that he would take 
    his time when choosing a note but would also bend his strings in ways that would make them melt into the next note.<br> his guiat solo's are some of the most sublime and influenced me to take different approaches towards choosing each note as 
I play. <br>  <a href="https://www.inspireuplift.com/David-Gilmour-Png-Transparent-Digital-Download-File-For/iu/10692635">Image Source</a>

    <h5>Jimi Hendrix</h5>

       this is a JPG! <br> Jimi Hendrix is considered by many to be one of the greatest and most influential guitarists to have ever lived, and I agree.<br>
        Jimi inspired me to play guiat in ways I could never have imagined, the virtuoso seemingly reinvented an instrument in a way that seemed a feat of that of Mozart or Beethoven. <br> Hendrix taught
        me how to take unique approaches to playing outside of the fundamentals while still creating art that sounded good.
